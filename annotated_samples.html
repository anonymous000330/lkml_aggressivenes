                    data on the senders side, and stop the idiocy. You are going to get cross-CPU cacheline

                    local data, you're missing the whole POINT of having per-cpu data in the first place.

                    That's really nasty; mntput_no_expire() (and thus mntput()) wants
                    br_write_lock()/br_write_unlock(). Right now we *know* that mntput() is non-blocking in
                    situations when we are holding more than one reference. With that kind of change that isn't true
                    anymore - one needs to have long-term refs to make it safe. And that's not going to be fun to

                    In the last couple of days I _have_ merged 50+ trees, and while there's
                    been some 'heated discussion' about some of them (you know who you are ;),
                    I'm hoping that we're actually in reasonably good shape even though it's
                    in the middle of the merge window, and that people will test out the
